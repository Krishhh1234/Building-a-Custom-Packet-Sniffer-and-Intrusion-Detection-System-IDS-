# Building-a-Custom-Packet-Sniffer-and-Intrusion-Detection-System-IDS-
This project is a Python-based custom Packet Sniffer and Intrusion Detection System (IDS) designed to monitor and analyze network traffic in real-time. It captures packets on a specified network interface, logs their details, and detects malicious patterns using regular expressions. The system is built using Python 3 and the Scapy library for packet sniffing, making it a powerful tool for network security enthusiasts and professionals. All captured packet details are saved in traffic_log.txt, while detected malicious patterns are logged in alerts.log. When the script is stopped, it generates a summary report in report.txt.

To set up the project, you need to have Python 3 and pip installed on your system. First, install the required library by running pip3 install scapy in your terminal. Once the setup is complete, execute the script with elevated privileges using sudo python3 packet_sniffer_ids.py to start monitoring network traffic. The script can be stopped anytime using CTRL+C. You can view the captured packet logs in traffic_log.txt, alerts in alerts.log, and a summary report in report.txt.

To customize the script, modify the network interface used in the sniff function. Replace "eth0" with your actual interface, such as "wlan0" or "enp0s3", depending on your network setup. This project is designed to work on Linux-based systems and has been tested on Ubuntu. It requires elevated privileges for packet sniffing, so make sure to run the script with sudo.

Future improvements could include adding support for reading from PCAP files, integrating machine learning for advanced intrusion detection, and enhancing cross-platform compatibility for Windows and macOS. This project demonstrates skills in network security, packet analysis, and traffic pattern detection, making it a great addition to your portfolio or cybersecurity projects.
